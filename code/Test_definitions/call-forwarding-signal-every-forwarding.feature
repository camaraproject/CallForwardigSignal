  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A device object identified by a phone number for which the call forwarding service status could be retrieved
  # * A device object identified by a phone number for which the call forwarding service status could not be retrieved
  #
  Background: Common call-forwarding-signal setup
    Given the path "/call-forwardings"
    And the header "Content-Type" is set to "application/json"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" is set to a UUID value
    And the request body is set by default to a request body compliant with the schema
